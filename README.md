# Business Card Built with React
### Live site: https://my-react-business-card.netlify.app/

## Overview
This business card was a solo project from [The Scrimba Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com). I was provided a Figma File, but chose to personalize the color scheme and a bit of the content. 

The purpose of building this static site in React was to practice React syntax and creating React components. 

My focus during the building process was creating a visually appealing and accessible design and color palette, as well writing clean readable code.
